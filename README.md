# AS Software Systems Development Coursework
C# maths quiz using visual studio forms. For AS-Level Software Systems Development

### Running It
This is a Visual Studio Project so please use this to run the application. I have also included the documentation and testing files.

### About
For my AS Software Systems Development coursework, I was required to develop a quiz based application using visual studio and C#. I chose to make a math based quiz with a variety of different input variations, including:
```
• True or False 
• Drag and Drop 
• Numeric Up Down 
• Multiple Choice 
• Multiple Answer
```
Using MoSCoW prioritisation, I came up with the requirements myself. The majority of which were incorporated in the final project, including "Could-Haves" such as avatars and player high-scores. Before commencing programming, I produced plans in the forms of written ideas and rules as well as storyboards to help me visualise the UI. Being my first C# project, I am delighted with the quiz and its aesthetics, especially as I completed all my targets and still added more functionality.
